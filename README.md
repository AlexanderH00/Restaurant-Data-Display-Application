# Restaurant-Data-Display-Application
 The Restaurant Data Display Application is a Python-based tool that fetches and displays restaurant information based on postcodes. It aims to provide a straightforward way for users to access specific restaurant details, such as names, cuisines, ratings, and addresses, from a public API. This project is ideal for users interested in exploring dining options in different UK regions and serves as a practical example of API integration and data processing using Python.
# Features
 Data Fetching: Retrieves restaurant data dynamically based on the input postcode.
 Data Filtering: Extracts and displays only relevant data from the API, focusing on the restaurant's name, cuisine types, ratings, and address.
 Limited Data Display: Limits the output to the first 10 restaurants to ensure clarity and ease of use.
 Error Handling: Implements basic error handling for API connectivity issues and data processing errors.
 # Technologies Used
 Python: The entire application is written in Python, taking advantage of its powerful libraries.
 Requests: Used for performing HTTP requests to the API.
 JSON: For parsing and handling data returned from the API.
 # Installation
  1 Clone the Repository: 
  git clone https://github.com/AlexanderH00/restaurant-data-display.git
  cd restaurant-data-display
  2 Install Dependencies:
  pip install requests
# How to Run

  cd restaurant-data-display
  2 Run the Application:
  python fetch_data.py
Follow the prompts to enter a UK postcode when requested by the application.
# Data Source
The application utilizes the Just Eat public API to fetch restaurant data. This API provides a wide range of data about restaurants, including but not limited to, names, addresses, cuisines, and ratings. The API is accessed via endpoints that require a postcode to return relevant restaurant information for that area.
# Additional Notes for README
 Assumptions: Document any assumptions you've made during the development. For example, assuming the API always returns data in a specific format.
 Possible Improvements: Discuss potential enhancements like adding more robust error handling, supporting more detailed queries, or creating a graphical user interface.
 Contributing: Encourage others to contribute by providing guidelines on how they can contribute to the project, who they should contact, and any required steps such as coding standards or pull request processes.
 This README layout offers a clear and detailed guide to help you understand and effectively operate the application. It also lays a solid foundation for future development and collaboration.
